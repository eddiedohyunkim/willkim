			<p>SASU, Self Protection in Progress, 2023 — Graduation Thesis Collection at Parsons School of Design</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p class="paragraph">
						In the collection, I re interpreted the DNA of confidence and sensitivity based on my personal history of emotional fragility and social pressure that I have faced my intention of pursuing the image of a deeply charismatic woman is a significant part of this collection. This is the story of overcoming one's own inner weakness and. Low self-esteem through my clothes and becoming stronger. SASU is a korean word meaning complete protection and tight defense. It is used in a situation where a person or a thing is in a desperate need of protection. Like the saying, the best defense is a good offense. In military term it also means a person who shoots guns or arrows. This  sense of SASU truly captures the essence of this collection. In order to protect something of great value, you have to fight for it. With this notion, my concept for this collection is about protecting my vulnerability but yet giving a placebo effect of gaining self confident.
